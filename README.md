# The Empathy Engine 🎙️

*Give AI a human voice.*
An advanced web app that generates expressive speech based on the emotion of your text.

---

## 🌟 Overview

The Empathy Engine is a full-stack web application designed to move beyond monotone, robotic speech. It analyzes text to determine its emotional content and then uses a multi-engine Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to generate audio that reflects the detected emotion.

---

## ✨ Core Features

* 🧠 **Multi-Engine Emotion Analysis**: Switch between VADER, TextBlob, and a Hugging Face DistilRoBERTa model for nuanced emotion detection.
* 🔊 **Multi-Engine TTS Synthesis**: Supports multiple TTS backends, from free options like gTTS to high-quality synthesis with Google Cloud TTS.
* 🔄 **Intelligent Fallback System**: If the primary TTS engine fails, the app automatically falls back to a secondary one for high availability.
* 🎭 **Granular Emotional Mapping**: Maps text to seven distinct emotional levels (e.g., *Very Positive*, *Slightly Negative*) for finer control over vocal output.
* ⚙️ **Configurable via Environment**: Easily switch emotion and TTS engines by setting environment variables—no code changes needed.
* 🌐 **Modern Web Interface**: Clean, responsive UI built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* 🩺 **Health & Config Endpoints**: Includes `/health` and `/config` API endpoints for easy monitoring and introspection.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd <repository-folder-name>
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file:

```txt
flask
python-dotenv
vaderSentiment
gtts
pyttsx3
# Optional but recommended
transformers
torch
textblob
# For Google Cloud TTS
google-cloud-texttospeech
```

Install all packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Your Engines

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# --- OPTIONAL: Set your preferred engines ---
EMOTION_ENGINE=ensemble   # Options: vader, huggingface, textblob, ensemble
TTS_ENGINE=gtts           # Options: gtts, pyttsx3, google_cloud, macos_say

# To enable Google Cloud TTS, provide the path to your credentials file.
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/google-credentials.json"
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will start locally (default: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)).

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

* **Emotion Analysis**: The *ensemble* mode prioritizes Hugging Face for accuracy, but gracefully falls back to VADER for reliability.
* **Speech Synthesis**: Abstracts the complexity of different TTS engines. For gTTS, different accents (via `tld`) simulate emotional variation—offering vocal variety at no extra cost.

This fallback-first approach makes the Empathy Engine both **powerful for advanced setups** and **accessible for minimal ones**.
